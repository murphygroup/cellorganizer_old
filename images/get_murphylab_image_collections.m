% GET_MURPHYLAB_IMAGE_COLLECTIONS Helper function that downloads Murphy
% Lab's image collections used by CellOrganizer for model creation and
% demonstrations
%
% The collections are
% * 3D HeLa cells [2.4 GB]
% * 3D movies of T cells expressing LAT (the zip file is 1.2 GB but it
%   expands to 2.6 GB)
