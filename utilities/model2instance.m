% March 8, 2012 Added location option to param structure and set a default value to 'all'
%
% March 21, 2012 Changed protein.location parameter to protein.cytonuclearflag
%
% October 17, 2012 D. Sullivan added param.cellresolution and param.objresolution
% and resizing code to make everything the resolution of the object model
% being synthesized.
%
% November 14, 2012 D. Sullivan fixed bugs in resizing cell/nuclear images
% to match object size. Needed to reset param.cell and param.nucleus and
% resize the param.nucleardist and param.celldist images as well
%
% November 15, 2012 I. Cao-Berg Changed warning to regular display
%
% January 21, 2013 D. Sullivan updated resolution framework s.t. user may
% now specify multiple object model resolutions and the output will be in
% the form of the lowest resolution (highest numbers since resolutions =
% microns/pixel)
%
% January 21, 2013 D. Sullivan fixed bug where file was returning if no PSF
% was used. This was necessary to have the file run to the end and resize
% to the output resolution. Moved PSF application to after image resize.
%
% January 21, 2013 D. Sullivan added resolution field to psf and resized
% based on output resolution. Prints message to user informing of resize.
%
% January 22, 2013 I. Cao-Berg modified if statement so that it checks
% whether field exists before querying it
%
% February 4, 2013 D. Sullivan added outres argument to arguments returned.
%
% February 9, 2013 D. Sullivan added imXYZ which is a cell array of each MT
% position in addition to the outputs already returned by
% model2microtubules
%
% February 20, 2013 D. Sullivan fixed bug which was forcing 'sampled'
% version of the code to be binary.
%
% February 27, 2013 D. Sullivan fixed up/downsampling for all patterns to
% occur in this function so that it is done consistently and functions
% downsampling things only upsample again after passing back a smaller data
% matrix (should speed things up a bit)
%
% September 25, 2013 D. Sullivan added corrections for rounding errors that
% allowed objects that were resized to end up outside the cell.
%
% May 25, 2016 I. Cao-Berg Fixed references to model class and type
%
% November 13, 2016 I. Cao-Berg Updated switch to match the model classes
% and types described in the documentation
%
% January 24, 2017 Xiongtao Ruan Added reference to T cell model
% 
% February 5, 2017 I. Cao-Berg Modified function so that microtubules patterns
%                  remain grayscale after adjusting resolution
% 
% May 21, 2019 Xiongtao Ruan Added matching of resolutions of mesh
