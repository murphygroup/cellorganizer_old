function FV = getMeshPoints(image, savepath, downsampling, options)
%GETMESHPOINTS This function gets mesh points given an image
%
%Inputs: 
%image = a 2D or 3D image 
%savepath = path to save image after preprocessing (D.mat), can be empty
%downsampling = downsampling fraction (1 means no downsampling, 1/5 means 1/5 the size)
%
%Outputs:
%FV = a struct containing the vertices etc for the mesh

%Parameters
%%%
padAmount = 3;%This creates padding to close the sides, top and bottom of the mesh
%ideally this would be resolution dependent
blurAmount = 11;%This smooths the image slightly to create a more smoothed mesh and reduce artifacts from pixelization
%This value was empirically chosen for the HeLa data, but may be different
%for different membrane properties, resolutions etc
%should not hard code this.
