function sbmlStruct = createImg2SBMLstruct(images,param)
% CREATEIMG2SBMLSTRUCT This function returns a structure for saving as SBML-Spatial
%
% Inputs
% ------
% images = cell array containing images to be saved as SBML-spatial
%
% Outputs
% -------
% framework = a struct for framework objects with triangulated mesh type
% encoding
% instance2SBML.m to generate a SBML-Spatial instance.
