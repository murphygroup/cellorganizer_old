Implementation of low-rank distance matrix completion algorithm
(c) 2011 Bamdev Mishra and Gilles Meyer

This package contains a Matlab implementation of the low-rank distance
completion algorithm presented in the paper

B. Mishra, G. Meyer and R. Sepulchre
Low-rank optimization for distance matrix completion
Submitted to the 50th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, December 2011

The implementation is due to 
Bamdev Mishra <b.mishra@ulg.ac.be> and Gilles Meyer <g.meyer@ulg.ac.be>

The implementation is a research prototype and is provided AS IS. 
No warranties or guarantees of any kind are given. Do not distribute this
code or use it other than for your own research without permission of the authors.

Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Installation:

- Set current directory as your current folder in Matlab or put it in your Matlab path
- To check that everything works, type "Example.m" at Matlab command prompt
  (you should see a plot with the decrease of the cost function in the end)
- Also find the Helix example from paper in the folder "Tests"
