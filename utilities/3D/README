The software and data used for the following paper can be downloaded 
below:

T. Peng and R.F. Murphy (2011) Image-derived, Three-dimensional 
Generative Models of Cellular Organization. Cytometry Part A 
79A:383-391. 

This code has been tested on Matlab 7.10.0.499 (R2010A) for Linux x64.

REQUIREMENTS
============
-Matlab
 -Image Processing Toolbox
 -Statistics Toolbox
 -Spline Toolbox

INSTRUCTIONS
============

1) To recreate the results, i.e. the 8 figures and 1 table, from the article download the source and data 
from http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software/2011_Cytometry_Generative_Model/index.html

2) Expand the data and source code to the desired destination.
3) In Matlab set the location of the data and use it as an input argument to the 
   main method run
   
   e.g.
   >> imagepath = '/path/to/images/Hela/3D';
   >> run( imagepath )

3a) If you use the method run without input arguments, it will assume the location of 
    the data folder is '/images/Hela/3D'
