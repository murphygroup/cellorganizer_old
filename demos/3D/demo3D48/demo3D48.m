% This demo illustrates using CellOrganizer to train an updated version of
% protein distribution model following the approach described in
%
% K. T. Roybal, T. E. Buck, X. Ruan, B. H. Cho, D. J. Clark, R. Ambler,
% H. M. Tunbridge, J. Zhang, P. Verkade, C. WÃ¼lfing, and R. F. Murphy (2016)
% Computational spatiotemporal analysis identifies WAVE2 and Cofilin as 
% joint regulators of costimulation-mediated T cell actin dynamics.  
% Science Signaling 9:rs3. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aad4149.
%
% The updates include: 
%    1. one point synapse annotation is allowed as valid input; 
%    2. a method is implemented for synapse detection with only providing 
%       the first time point.
%    3. the method for aligmentment adjustment is implemented. 
% 
% The slowest step, which typically takes about 1 min per cell per frame,
% is to align each cell at each time to the standardized template.
% This demo uses 46 cells so it will take about 1 hour on a single core.
%
% Input 
% -----
% * image and annotation files for one or more proteins for the first 
% time point (the default is to use images from the paper of LAT at time 0 
% - downloading the needed images requires about 4 GB of free disk space)
%
% Output
% ------
% * a model for the average concentration in each voxel of a standardized
% cell shape (in demos/LAT_reltime_1.mat)
% * various intermediate results files (in /param and /tmp)
