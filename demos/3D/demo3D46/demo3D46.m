%
% This is the synthesis demo for T cell model. 
% The demo takes in two models: one model contains both cell and nuclear 
% shape models, and the other contains a T cell protein shape model. Same 
% as other synthesis framework, it calls slml2img for the synthesis. The 
% meanings of the options are commented in the script. 
%
% Input 
% -----
% * A protein model with type standardized map halp-elipsoid
% * A framework model the provide the shape of the cell. 
%
% Output
% ------
% * one or more set(s) of synthesized images with cell shape and protein
% pattern.
