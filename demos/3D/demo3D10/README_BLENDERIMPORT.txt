demo3D10 

This demo saves a .obj file as output for importing to blender. By using the cellblender plugin for blender one can then simulate agent based systems using mcell

To import the .obj file into blender: 

1. download, install and open blender[http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/] (and the cellblender plugin if desired[http://www.mcell.org/download.html])
2. go to File -> import -> Wavefron(.obj)
3. Navigate to the desired file e.g. ./demo3D10/synthesizedImages/cell1/cell
4. select the desired file and hit "Import OBJ" in the upper right of the screen

Note: Files may only be loaded one at a time in blender so to load all the results from this demo one must load cell.obj, nucleus.obj, and lysosome.obj
