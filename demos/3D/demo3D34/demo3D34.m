%
% Synthesize one 3D image with nuclear, cell shape and a vesicular channel. 
% This demo exports the synthetic image as an OME.TIFF as well as an 
% SBML Spatial instance.
%
% Input 
% -----
% * a valid CellOrganizer model
%
% Output
% ------
% * OME.TIFF
% * SBML instance
% * single channel TIF files
