% demo2D00
%
% Synthesize one 2D image with nuclear, cell shape, and vesicular channels
% from all vesicular object models (nucleoli, lysosomes, endosomes, and
% mitochondria) without convolution. The model was trained from the Murphy
% Lab 2D HeLa dataset.
%
% Input
% -----
% * a list of valid CellOrganizer model files
%
% Output
% ------
% * one TIFF file with six slices (nuclear, cell shape, nucleolar,
%   lysosomal, endosomal, and mitochondrial channels)
